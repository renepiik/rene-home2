![Me](/images/me.jpeg#me)

I am a full-time student of mathematics at the University of Tartu (graduating in 2023). I have worked as a news reporter (2016 - 2018), a frontend developer (2019 - 2020), a TA at the university (2020 - 2021) and a data analyst (2021).

I spend my time studying, reading and procrastinating on r/math. I represented Estonia at the international Toledo/Madrid MEP in 2018 and led my high school's student council for a year. Lately I haven't had as much time for extracurricular activities, but I'm looking to get back to writing and photography (as soon as I get my camera fixed).

Feel free to check out my GitHub page or follow my posts here with RSS! Up top you can find some of my projects. I usually write in Estonian.

If you have any questions, send them my way at renepiik@gmail.com.
