![Me](/images/me.jpeg#me)

I am a full-time student of mathematics at the University of Tartu (graduating in 2022). I have worked as a news reporter (2016 - 2018), a frontend web developer (2019 - 2020), a teacher's assistant at the university (2020 - 2021) and a data analyst (2021).

I largely spend my time studying, reading and procrastinating on r/math. I represented Estonia at the international Toledo/Madrid MEP in 2018 and led my high school's student council for a year. Lately I haven't had as much time for extracurricular activities, but looking to get back to writing and photography (as soon as I get my camera fixed).

Feel free to check out my GitHub page or follow me right here! Up top you can find any bigger (and more complete) projects or read my notes on various topics. I usually write in Estonian.

If you have any questions, send them my way at renepiik@gmail.com.
